# risk_of_multiprinting
A Risk of Rain 2 mod that allows printing multiple items.

Interacting with 3D printers pops up a UI to select up to 50 items to be printed simultanously:

![example image](/examples/multiprinting-ui-example.png)

- Use the slider or +/- buttons to select how many items to print 
- Then press `F` or click the `Print (F)` button
- If you have enough scrap and/or other items of the same rarity the selected number of items is printed

Scrap is consumed before any other items. 

Pressing `spacebar` or walking will abort the interaction.
